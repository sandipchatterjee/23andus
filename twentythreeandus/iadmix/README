iADMIX, version 0.2, Vikas Bansal (vibansal@ucsd.edu), last modified: October 7 2014

Introduction
============

Inference of ancestry is an important aspect of disease association studies as well as for understanding population history. We have developed a fast and accurate method for estimating the admixture proportions for an individual's ancestry using genotype or sequence data and population allele frequencies from a set of parental/reference populations. The method can work with genotype data or sequence data (aligned sequence reads in a BAM file) derived from low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, exome-sequencing or even targeted sequencing experiments. The method uses the L-BFGS-B code  (a limited memory BFGS algorithm with bound constraints) for optimizing the likelihood function and is extremely fast. The program (binaries compiled for Linux x86_64) can be downloaded from attachments below. 

The method is described in the paper: "Fast individual ancestry inference from DNA sequence data leveraging allele frequencies from multiple populations". Vikas Bansal and Ondrej Libiger. (submitted) 


CODE DESCRIPTION:
=================

There are three components of the code: 

a. runancestry.py is a python script that is the front-end to pre-process the input data and run the method
b. "ANCESTRY" is the compiled C executable that has code implementing the main method
c. "calculateGLL" is an auxilliary C executable that contains the program to calculate the genotype likelihoods from sorted bam files 


Requirements:
=============

To run the program, you need at least the following files: 

1. Input genotype or sequence reads file: currently three different formats are accepted: 
	
	(a) file with aligned reads for the individual diploid genome. iADMIX currently accepts BAM files that are coordinate sorted, i.e. by chromosomal position. 
	(b) simple genotype file with two columns (rsid genotype) for SNPs
	(c) PLINK .ped and .map files 


2. population allele frequency file with allele frequency at SNPs for multiple populations. A sample file using HapMap data is provided for analysis.  



Running the program:
=====================

A python script runancestry.py is used to pre-process the input files and run the method to estimate admixture coefficients. 

The command "python runancestry.py"  will provide a list of options for running the program. 

Example: python runancestry.py --freq hapmap3.allchroms.shared.matrix --geno HGDP01254.genotypes --out HGDP12054.ancestry
Example: python runancestry.py --freq hapmap3.allchroms.shared.matrix --bam HGDP01254.sorted.bam --out HGDP12054.ancestry
Example: python runancestry.py --freq hapmap3.allchroms.shared.matrix --plink HGDP01254.genotypes (ped/map) --out HGDP12054.ancestry


Usage: runancestry.py [options]
